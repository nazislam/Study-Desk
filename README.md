# Study-Desk

Project "Study Desk" for CSC498 - Internship.

In order to run the application:

First, install Node from [Nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) website.

Clone the repository by `git clone https://github.com/nazislam/Study-Desk.git`

Navigate to the directory and open a terminal and do npm install. This will install the dependancies for the backend (Express) of the application.

Navigate to `client` directory and do `npm install` to install the Angular dependencies.

Once all the dependencies are installed, run the server.

RUNNING THE SERVER:

In terminal, navigate to the root project folder (where `app.js` and `package.json` exist) and do `npm start`. This will run the run express backend on port 3000. 

Once the backend server is running, navigate to `client` directory and do `npm start`, which will open the server in browser on port 4200.


Once the serve is running, access it `http://localhost:4200`.
